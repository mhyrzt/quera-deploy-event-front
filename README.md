# 🚀 LevelUp6: Web Dev and Deployment Portfolio Project

Welcome to the LevelUp6: Web Dev and Deployment Portfolio Project repository! This project is part of the LevelUp6 event and serves as a hands-on demonstration of web development and deployment using HTML and CSS. By the end of this project, you'll have a functional portfolio website ready to be deployed using GitHub Pages.

The LevelUp6: Web Dev and Deployment Portfolio Project is designed to help you build a simple yet effective personal portfolio website. Whether you're just starting with web development or want to showcase your skills and projects, this project will guide you through the process step by step.

In this project, you will learn:

- Basic HTML structure and tags.
- Styling your portfolio using CSS.
- Organizing and presenting your skills and projects.
- Reimplementing styles with [💨 `TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Deploying your portfolio website using GitHub Pages.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork & Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/levelup6-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). If you don't have VSCode installed, you can download it from [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. Install the Live Server extension for VSCode. You can do this by following these steps:

   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for "Live Server" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Click the "Install" button for the "Live Server" extension.

4. With the project open in VSCode, open the `index.html` file.

5. In the bottom right corner of the VSCode window, you'll see the "Go Live" button. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Alt+L` followed by `Alt+O` to run the web server.

This will launch a live development server, and your portfolio will be automatically opened in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the HTML or CSS files will trigger an automatic refresh in the browser, making the development process more efficient and interactive.

Now you can start customizing your portfolio by editing the HTML and CSS files as described in the "Usage" section.
